It was a horrible time in my life due to living with my mother and finally having the chance to cut her out of my life. I can admit because of it was an emotional wreck and this guy was stable and didn't know how to deal with me. We ended by him avoiding for a month or so after going to a festival with my friends. When I think back I wish he just ended. So after he ended it added my depression I suffered but my friends helped me through it and I got rid of everything from him along with cutting contact. \\n\\nNow: Its been almost 3 years now and I've gotten better after counselling and mild anti depressants. My mother has been out of my life since then so there's been alot of progress. Being stronger after learning some lessons there been more insight about that time of my life but when I see him or a picture everything comes back. The emotions and memories bring me back down. \\n\\nHis friends (both girls) are on my facebook because we get along well which is hard to find and I know they'll always have his back. But seeing him in a picture or talking to him at a convention having a conversation is tough. Crying confront of my current boyfriend is something I want to avoid. \\n\\nSo I've been thinking that I have to cut contact with these girls because it's time to move on because it's healthier. It's best to avoid him as well. But will they be insulted? Will they accept it? Is there going to be awkwardness? I'm not sure if it's the right to do and could use some outside opinions.\\n\\nSummary:\\n\",\n",

I\\'d hit a plateau the last four weeks or so where I was stuck at 222. Felt like kind of a bummer, but knew it\\'s because I haven\\'t been as strict as I should with my diet, and the last week and a half have been crazy with life things, so I haven\\'t been exercising as frequently as I\\'ve gotten used to. When I weighed myself as normal on Monday, I was kind of disappointed to see the scale not budging and figured it was time to buckle down again and really watch my diet. Today was my measure-in day, and I\\'ve felt cruddy in general since Monday because I caught some chest congestion/cold bug over the weekend. I get on the scale...it says 219. Whaaaaat? I take my measurements, which are down slightly from last month, and with an total-body loss of 8 inches from my starting point on 12/23/14! Some of my clothes have been feeling a bit looser as of late and now I know it\\'s just not in my head.

Frankly, the only reason I\\'m not asking them out is because I know that I have some insecurities that need to be worked through - particularly in the realm of body image. While I\\'m confident in the rest of my body, I\\'ve had terrible, awful acne both on my arms and breasts since I was very young. It\\'s a special type with no complete cure, but doctors suggested that I keep my skin oiled until it goes away (dryness irritates it). Because of this it\\'s not so much present anymore as large clusters of scars are.\\n\\nWould I warn someone about this upfront before anything sexual? Would I just let it surprise them when the clothes come off? Do I tell them \"Let\\'s keep on my shirt for now\" while we do our business? \\n\\nHave you had experiences with anything similar?

Minimum payment per month total is $301.16. Over the next 9 months, I will pay off $11k of these, which will get rid of everything above 5% interest and will drop the total minimum payment to $150. \\n\\nAt the end of the 9 months, our savings will be around $35k.

So more realistically $25-30k. \\n\\nSometime in the future, between a year to two years from now, my husband and I may be moving. Typical single family homes in this area go for around $300k. \\n\\nAt the end of the 9 months, should I continue to focus on paying down student debt (which will be a balance of $14k by then) or growing our savings/down payment? I have $5200/mo to somehow split between debt and down payment and I'm not sure how best to allocate it.\\n\\nSummary:\\n\",\n",
       " '\\nSummarize the following reddit post.\\n\\nThrowaway\\n\\nI noticed the more I\\'m cold and distant towards my girlfriend, the more pleasant she becomes. She\\'ll come over and clean my apartment, do laundry, dishes and cook for me, even as far as to offer oral favors while I\\'m drinking a beer! \\n\\nShe seems completely happy and content during this time, which makes me happy and I naturally want to do things back for her. As soon as I start doing her favors, she picks fights and complains nonstop. Latest issue was I offered to take her and her mom to dinner. She kept giving me shit about how I\\'m going to be spending too much time with my brother (who\\'s visiting for a week soon), which she was totally fine with when I was being distant with her. She\\'ll call me a bitch in a joking way, and just take the piss out of me whenever I\\'m kind or go out of my way to apologize. \\n\\nThis naturally makes me feel cold and indifferent toward her. Once she senses that, she\\'s all about making me the happiest boyfriend and apologizes for all the shit she was giving me the week previously. It\\'s a vicious cycle but I\\'m not sure what to do here. I\\'ve brought this up with her and she recognizes it and has no solution. She just \"feels differently towards me sometimes\" and can\\'t explain it.\\n\\n**So what do I do here? Do I keep up the aloof, distant attitude to keep her interested or suffer her negging in kindness, my default setting.\\n\\nSummary:\\n']"

I hope this isn\\'t too trivial of a question to ask on here, but I\\'ve been feeling a bit out of my depth when it comes to this situation (I\\'ve had only one relationship before, and for many reasons, it was out of the ordinary).\\n\\nOkay! So, a couple of weeks ago, I started talking to this guy on Facebook, through a student group that we were both part of. I thought he was sort of cute, so I sent him a PM just to talk, etc, etc. We\\'re both transfer students at the same school, so I knew that we could eventually meet in person once we both moved on-campus. So, we did, and we hung out maybe twice, just as friends.\\n\\nOkay. So, everything is going pretty well. We talk over Facebook and Snapchat, whatever. So, Saturday night, I was just hanging out with people and kind of being bored, when I got a Snapchat from him asking what I was doing. I asked if he wanted to hang out, so we did. \\n\\nWe ended up smoking pot (the first time for me, ever), and sort of just wandering around. Eventually we ended up back at his dorm room, where high me decided to just go for it, and I came on to him pretty strongly. It worked out for me (luckily, otherwise things would have been really super awkward), and we ended up messing around but not having sex.\\n\\nYesterday, however, I ended up going to hang out with him again, and this time we did sleep together. Afterward, we kind of discussed what we were going to do, and he just said that he wanted to \"play it by ear\" and not slap any labels on anything. I\\'m wondering if this means that he wants a fwb-type situation, or if he might actually be interested in me. The way I\\'ve been acting is extremely out of character for me, and I am not interested in having a fuck buddy. I like him, and I would be very interested in maybe seeing where things go, but I\\'m worried that I may have ruined my chances of a relationship by sleeping with him already.\\n\\n    Summary:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!',\n",

After the ceremony everyone walks outside the building and onto the other side of the small road the hearses drive down. Now the road is important because obviously if there\\'s a road, there\\'s a curb onto the sidewalk, so most of us are on the other side of the road, besides a few older people walking a lot slower. \\n\\nAs one of the old woman goes to walk up the curb she trips (obviously didn\\'t notice there was one due to crying and whatnot) and I\\'m the only one who not only sees it coming but is in any position to do anything. So of course as someone who is an avid football (soccer if you\\'re American) player my first instinct is to stick my foot out and kind of control her head like you would with a football.\\n\\nOf course you can imagine this looked horrendously bad on my part (quite literally kicking an old woman while she\\'s down) and as she got up everyone noticed that her nose was completely grey/black as if she\\'d just been punched in the face. She assures us she\\'s fine and we go to the dinner afterwards where someone finally informs her of her bruising. She goes to the toilet and comes out with a completely normal looking nose so of course everyone\\'s wondering how and it turns out that the \"bruising\" was actually shoe polish from my shoe, confirming to everyone that i kicked this poor old lady square in the face as she fell.\\n\\n    Summary:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!',\n",

       " \"\\n    Summarize the following reddit post.\\n\\n    I have a horrible caffeine addiction, and I don't like sacrificing any of my daily calories for coffee. I used to drink 5-6 Diet Dr. Peppers a day, but I have switched to almost exclusively drinking only water most days. I do have a Diet Dr. Pepper occasionally, and I know that technically it's okay to probably have one a day, but I honestly just feel better all around when I drink only water. But if I don't have some caffeine in the morning, I will be writhing in the floor in pain with a skull-pounding headache by mid-day. I know. Ridiculous, right? \\n\\nSo, I went to the vitamin aisle the other day in search of a supplement with a little caffeine and the only thing I found was One A Day Adult Vitacraves Gummies with Energy Support. Here's the website with [nutritional info] One serving is 20 calories and has 90 mg of caffeine. There's also some vitamin B6, B12, and folic acid in there that supposedly helps turn food into energy. I have no idea if that's true. I've been taking them a couple days, and so far I do feel more energized and I haven't had any headaches. The issue is that one bottle is around $9 and there are only 60 in a bottle. You have to take 4 (4!) a day, which is very intriguing considering the brand name and all. So it'll cost me around $20 a month. Which is admittedly cheaper than what I used to spend on Diet Dr. Peppers, but still. I was just curious if anyone else had a better option for caffeine in a supplement or vitamin?\\n\\n    Summary:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\",\n",
       " '\\n    Summarize the following reddit post.\\n\\n    So, this actually happened yesterday. I am currently studying abroad in a tropical country. As a result, the selection of locally grown fruit is phenomenal. Now, I\\'m not usually one for bananas, but I keeping hearing they are much more flavorful here, so I decided I\\'d give it a go and bought a small bunch from the local market. Yesterday morning, I decided I\\'d have one for breakfast along with my usual corn flakes. After I wash it down with coffee, I immediately start feeling like crap, but one of my roommates had a stomach bug over the weekend, so I just automatically assume that I must have contracted said bug and rush off to my four hour class. Four hours of hell, that is. As soon as I sit down, my nose becomes a waterfall with off and on sneezing fits. Next, cue the most god awful indigestion and acid reflux I have ever experienced. I keep telling myself that I only have to make it to 1 o\\' clock, then I can just go to bed. Easier said than done, but I finally get home and find little success in napping. Once I get up, I discover that I have a nice little rash starting in each armpit, which I chalk up to having switched deodorants just that morning. Finish off a bottle of Maalox with some advil and commenced sleep attempt number two. I wake up a little more clear headed this time and begin to assess my situation. The rash is now worse and I start wondering, what if the deodorant didn\\'t cause the rash? Is there a single thing that could possibly explain all of my symptoms? I started to ask myself out loud, \"Did I eat anything today that I don\\'t usually..... oh, shit.\" In an instant my fingers were flying on Google to search \"banana allergy\" only to find a multitude of symptom lists that pretty much specifically described my day of hell. By this time, my face had even started to swell a bit, but now knowing what I  was up against, I bought some benedryl, had a couple of beers and went back to sleep. Woke up this morning feeling much better, and unlike Pam Poovey, I will not continue to stuff my face with foods I know I am allergic to. No more bananas.

       " \"\\n    Summarize the following reddit post.\\n\\n    My dad just turned 83 last week. The (sort of) short version of the chain of events is this. Last year he fell in the shower then didn't go to the doctor. For about the next 3 days he got weaker and more tired. He started hallucinating (seeing his dead brother in the room, etc.) so my mom got him to the hospital. He had lost a lot of blood through presumably some internal bleeding. They got more blood in him and stabilized so after a week he went home. He recovered pretty well.\\n\\nFast forward to October and one morning he couldn't get up off the couch, had no energy and was looking really bad, so back to the hospital he goes. He spent two weeks there this time (and had to miss my brother's wedding) because it was an infection in his blood and it took a while to get the right antibiotics in him to knock out the infection.\\n\\nThree days ago my dad was back in the hospital again for being weak and hallucinating. Low on blood again so they've given him more, but he's still too weak to get out of bed, so we don't know how long he'll be there.\\n\\nI'm starting to get really worried that he doesn't have much time left. He *just* retired about 3 months ago, and to think that now he could be near the end really sucks. He has lived to an older age than all of his siblings except one half-sister. I'm only 37 and I'm not ready to not have my dad around.\\n\\nNot really looking for comments or advice, but just needed a place to write it out.

It also stated that he would be responsible for the attorney fees and any and all legal fees associated with pursuing the case in court.\\n\\nBeing a non-binding HOA, I assume that they are only able to enforce the covenants outlined in the deed for the property which was created by the now-no-longer builder of the neighborhood 35ish years ago.

Right after I turned 18 years old my parents stopped doing everything, so this kid knowing me maybe 3months really started helping me a lot with rides to work, school, ect. But after 2 months got really annoyed with it even if I offered money he still thought of me as a nusense. So finally I just quit my job, well my parents got pissed about that too.

I got a job and worked about 70 hours a week and my boyfriend would get upset that he wouldn\\'t see me. So I would try and make time for him anyway I could and ask him to go on dates. The issue there is he would get embarrised because he had no money, he didn\\'t work and I would accidentally bring it up. He started to really hate me for this. Finally he kicked me out so I lived with my sister in another state, he started to miss me and would drive up to see me. So I finally moved back, then around 3 months same issue came up and I came home to find all my stuff packed up. So I moved back with my parents but still saw him every week. Then we came into some issues with one of his friends (this kid always needs attention and does anything to get it). He was saying a lot of stuff about me, which got back to me and I assumed my boyfriend said it. I lost it and wrote a mean Facebook status (I know,childish).

I later had to tell them I was the girlfriend to which they replied,\"Sorry, we didn\\'t know he had a girlfriend.\" We always had each other\\'s facebook passwords as a form trust. He changed his facebook password and had me walk to the otherside of the room as he typed his info in. I tried to ask him about this and just changed the subject.\\n\\nOver the past two months, he has made no effort to see me. He has never called me. He did not acknowledge Valentine\\'s day or my birthday. There have been a few texts here and there,but nothing of real substance. About a week ago he sent he a picture of a glass he bought.

So, recently single.\\n\\nSo this guy, we\\'ll call him R, works with me. About a month ago we started hanging out outside of work. I was a little interested in him at first, not taking it too seriously. Then the second time we hung out he kissed me. I was caught off guard, but found myself even more interested in him after that. We hung out a couple more times, made out, hand holding etc, so a couple weeks later I felt like I was developing feelings for him. \\n\\nThen last night we go out and get super drunk... I end up staying over and we had sex, which was good... But then I\\'m drunkenly talking to him and tell him \"I kinda like you.\" his response was \"i have a lot of fun with you\" but \"we haven\\'t hung out that much.\"\\n\\nI feel frustrated that he uses us not hanging out much as a reason not to like me because he is the one who started the whole thing right away by kissing me. Now im just super nervous around him and a little depressed now because I feel like I was just friend zoned by a guy after having sex with him. Basically I feel really shitty about myself and really regretting last night.\\n\\nWhat do you guys think I should do? Is there any chance of him actually liking me or was this pretty much it?\\n\\n    Summary:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!',\n",

He joined the marine reserves a few years ago and has now become more arrogant, openly racist, and carries himself with a false sense of authority. I've talked to him less and less over the past few years in hopes that would get the hint that I don't really enjoy our time together anymore. \\n\\nI've started ignoring his calls/texts and probably haven't spoken to him in 6 months.

The last time we saw each other we went out for his birthday and I was completely embarrassed to be in public with him. He was rude to every waiter/bartender we encountered. He tried to impress people with fake stories of serving in Afghanistan (he's never been deployed), tried to start fights, and at the end of the night he drunkenly berated a taxi driver after they missed a turn, and launched into a tirade about being sick of fighting for stupid immigrants in his country. \\n\\nGiven the amount of history we have, I'm unsure how to respond.

This is rarely a problem because I hang out with dog people, but meeting new people can sometimes be a pain. \\n\\nWhen someone starts walking up to us and Reggie notices, he starts to pull towards them.

Unfortunately, this means there's a huge dog jumping up at people's faces like a missile.

So i call the number on their reciept and the girl answers and says she will come open the door. She opens the door and sure enough she is very pretty, and was around my age. (18) She greets me very warmly and smiles the whole time and I give her Her food and leave.\\n\\nAbout 4 hours later I am working out and decided to check my phone, Ten minutes earlier I had a missed call, from the number of the girl i delievered to. Im assuming it was the girl, and not the very old woman I saw in her house (looked to be her grandma) especially since it said the call was from a mobile phone. Anyway I texted her back saying hello and that i didnt hear the phone when she called.\\n\\nI havent got any response back. But It was almost errie how this whole thing played out, beginning with me having this gut feeling before i delivered the pizza. I really hope that I hear back from her. But if i dont, what is the best thing for me to do? Should i call her? I feel like that would maybe come off as weird. Maybe she just called me on accident or something and Im just reading way too much into this.\\nThank you for bearing with me, any advice is appreciated.\\n\\n    Summary:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!',\n",
       " \"\\n    Summarize the following reddit post.\\n\\n    I was diagnosed as being allergic to bee stings, and have had Epipen's since I was a child. I have been very cautious though, so i wouldn't get stung by a bee, as my case was very severe(If I didn't receive medical attention, via a Epipen shot or adrenaline injection, within the hour of a sting I would go into an anaphylactic shock, constricting my airways, and subsequently resulting in my death). Since Epipens cost anywhere from 60-120 dollars a year, and i hadn't been stung since i was a child, they decided to test and see if i was still allergic to them. We visited the clinic, and submitted a blood test to be tested, and were billed **$400** dollars for the test. when we got the results back, they told us it was inconclusive, and i might still be allergic, and i might not be allergic. \\nIt seemed like a scam almost, as they took our money, and provided us with no real information.\\n\\n    Summary:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!\",\n",
       " '\\n    Summarize the following reddit post.\\n\\n    We have Scottish terriers and two little purse dogs, and they love to romp around in my backyard, but I don\\'t let them out there without supervision because I\\'m afraid of them drowning in the pool.\\n\\nSo what I do is I find a nice shady area to camp out by the pool, let the dogs out, and listen to audiobooks and stuff while I watch them.\\n\\nThis approach worked really well, except it was incredibly hard to get them to come back in again. They *looove* to be outside, after all. So I trained them to respond to \"back inside!\", and as soon as they got in the door I gave them a treat. One of our more indoorsy dogs actually looks forward to the treat more than to going outside. Which is... good?\\n\\nAnyway, here\\'s the problem: Two of these dogs will eventually come back inside, but only after repeated badgering. They know that eventually I\\'ll walk over and pick them up, so they move at a snail\\'s pace to discourage me from doing that. Taking plenty of time to sniff every little thing that crosses their path.\\n\\nMy approach has been to give them smaller and smaller chunks of treat depending on how long it took for them to come back inside.\\n\\n    Summary:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!',\n",

Anyway, he asked me to stay friends with him and said, \"I don\\'t want to ever cut contact with you\". So we stayed friends and for some time it was okay.\\n\\nBut recently things started to change for worse. He shares with me really intimate thoughts and we talk for long hours (I\\'m abord right now so it\\'s mostly via messages). \\n\\nNeedless to say, I fell in love with him again. I don\\'t know how to deal with that. He also sends me somehow mixed signals which make me hope he\\'s into me romantically.

A couple weeks ago her brother and I had sex, it only happened once and we don't have feelings for eachother or anything. I guess she overheard him saying something about it to a friend or something, and yesterday she confronted me about it. I denied it at first but she kept saying she knows I did and stuff and after I kind of admitted it she got really pissed at me. She didn't hit me or anything but I could tell she was furious and I was like afraid, and she said stuff like I'm never to be near her brother again, and asked have I always been like preying on him and waiting for him to be old enough and all this stuff, I'm worried this will ruin our friendship. I think she said that stuff in the hear of the moment but I'm nervous around her now. I don't get why she's so overprotective of him, he's only a yeae younger than her.

The reason I'm wary of an extreme low carb diet like keto is just that I can't see myself doing it long-term.

Right now, we're extremely happy with each other and I told her that I loved her last week. Everything is great right now. Unfortunately, we won't be together for Christmas break, but we'll FaceTime each other and call regularly. \\n\\n  I've read posts about high school sweet hearts trying to take a relationship into college before, almost everything that I've read has resulted in a break up. I know that if her and I go down this road, I'll be devastated in the end. Second semester is going to fly by, and before we know it, we'll be going to prom. I know I should live in the moment here, and I've been trying to go along the lines of that, but I do want to start forming some kind of plan. \\n\\n  I should also mention that we're not going to the same college. She might go out of state, I'm going to community college for financial reasons, and she's getting accepted into four year universities. It would be a LDR. I love this girl, and I'm willing to compromise to stay with her. \\n\\n  Anyway, my question is: What should we do? Should I try to maintain a LDR with her?

       " '\\n    Summarize the following reddit post.\\n\\n    Hi, y\\'all.\\n\\nMy cousin and I were close once but she started demanding way too much from me and gets upset whenever I don\\'t do what she wants. After spending a lot of time here, I realize she\\'s a narcissist and so is her mom. It\\'s always about her and what she wants. Never any consideration for my feelings.\\n\\nAnyway, I was supposed to do day after Christmas shopping with her; picking her up and we drive around to different shops. She insisted on smoking in my brand new car that I just got in October. I told her I\\'d prefer not since I want to keep that as a nonsmoking car, whether if it\\'s cigarettes or pot. Plus she has a tendency to drop the blunt, she burned a hole in my other car which is why I didn\\'t want to smoke in the car at all. She wouldn\\'t let it go even though I said she could smoke before we left, so that made me not want to go shopping with her. She texted me this Christmas Eve asking if we were still going and I said probably not since I wasn\\'t feeling well, headache and the runs. Never heard back from her to this day. Last year wasn\\'t fun because she rushed me telling me we had to leave because she\\'s done at this store and kept telling me to stop buying so much because we wouldn\\'t have enough room. Yea, while her cart was full and I was carrying a shopping basket. \\n\\nSo since then I did a slow fade and I\\'ve noticed every time we see each other in person, she always says **\"you never text me anymore\", \"I\\'m mad at you\", etc.** My first response is to say \"phone works both ways.\" But that sounds smart-assed. I end up shrugging my shoulders and say I\\'m busy with school, which is true.\\n\\nWe\\'re having a birthday party tomorrow for my aunt, cousins mom and my cousin will be there and I KNOW she will say the same fucking thing again... So what is a good response without being a bitch about it?\\n\\n    Summary:!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!!']"
